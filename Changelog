2003-06-14	ujwal

    * Reverted back to v1.20 of VT100Typesetter accunting for line 
      endings at the end of the line instead of beginning since the 
      other version was more problematic. This version now handles 
      new line characters at the end correctly.
      
2003-06-13	ujwal

    * Fixed bug in VT100Typesetter line bounds calculation where 
      the new line character should be at the beginning rather 
      than at the end. Otherwise text ending in a new line character 
      will not display the ending new line.

2003-06-12	ujwal

    * Created VT100TextStorage class subclassing NSTextStorage.

2003-06-11	ujwal

    * Using embedded FreeMono font for graphical characters 
      since that font provides all the glyphs.
      
    * VT100Terminal does not set NSCharacterWidthAttributeName for ascii text.
      This is so that the custom typesetter can easily check 
      for double width characters by just looking for the existence of the 
      attribute.
      
    * Created VT100LayoutManager, a NSLayoutManager subclass to speed up 
      some operations such as window resizing.

2003-06-10	ujwal

    * Bug fixes and speed improvement to VT100Typesetter.

2003-06-09	fabian
    * Let VT100Typesetter layout every glyph. Glyph alignment
      problem solved. But, 
        1. speed is much slower (~2x), 
        2. change font with a large scrollback buffer takes for
           ever (due to re-layout, I think).
    * Added double width character support in VT100Typesetter.
           
2003-06-09	ujwal

    * Caching new line string in VT100Screen for big speed boost.

      Currently works only on rectangular selections.

2003-05-12	ujwal

    * Moved AddressBook file to new location under 
      ~/Library/Application Support/iTerm.
      
    * On startup, iTerm.app now looks for an "AutoLaunch.scpt"

      on new output if the user has scrolled up. It had 
      been interfering with the vttest program. Now we 
      auto-scroll down when the window size changes, so 
      vttest largely works.

2003-04-09	ujwal

    * Preliminary support for print-to-ansi.

    * Refresh now only updates the necessary part of screen
    
2003-03-26	ujwal

    * Created a new target "iTerm Framework" in the 
      project. This is the core of iTerm.app. The 
      iTerm application target just contains the 
      entry point source file and images. It then 
      links against the iTerm framework. This enables 
      other applications to link against iTerm framework 
      to embed iTerm functionality. 
      
    * Regrouped Preference and AddressBook elements into 
      separate NIB files. Created AddressBookWindowController 
      class.

2003-03-25	fabian
    * PTYTextView is now a subclass of NSView under ARRAY 
      mode. Text input works properly.

    * Added an alert window after configuration is saved.
    * Added shortcut option for address entry.
        Control-Option-Key: Open in new tab

    * Correct the yellow
        
2003-03-12	fabian

    * Fixed a bug related to reversed video mode.
    * Changed default black color to pure black.
    * Fixed some timer settings
    
2003-03-11	fabian
    * Changed the color code. Now we no longer have fixed
      bold text color. Instead, it's calculated from the
      base color. So we can choose whatever color we want
      again.
      
2003-03-10	fabian
    * Rewrite the color stuff in emulation code. Now we
      use seperate color table for normal and bold text.
      We now will using high color to indicate bold. Also,
      the color table will make the future implementation
      of customized ANSI color easier.
      Limitations: Any color you select for FG/BG will be
      converted to the closest color in the colorTable.
      Aslo, currently FG color will have no alpha.

2003-03-10	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added some missing semi-colons in Chinese strings files.


2003-03-08	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed an issue where '=', '/', and '*' could not be 
      typed from numeric keypad. This was because those 
      keys were mapped to the PF2, PF3, PF4 keys. Now we 
      have a numLock state that is on by default. When 
      state is enabled, numeric keypad has the default 
      operation. When it is disabled, the keys 
      'numlock', '=', '/', and '*' send PF1, PF2, PF3, 
      and PF4 sequences. The state can be toggled by using 
      Cmd-numLock. This behavior is basically the same as 
      that implemented in GLTerm.
      

2003-03-04	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in screen update
    
2003-03-04	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      enhancements and fixes for some bugs and memory leaks.
      

2003-03-02	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a screen update bug. Sometimes screen HAS to be 
      updated even if minIndex == [BUFFER length], e.g. when 
      doing ^u on the last line.
      

2003-03-01	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a warning bell orientation bug.
    

2003-02-28	fabian

      in BUFFER mode
      
2003-02-27	fabian
    * Fixed cursor code in ARRAY mode
    * Fixed more double-width character stuff in ARRAY mode, 
      display should be fully working now
    * We now use the taller one between font and nafont to
      decide the lineHeight.
    * Fixed bugs in scrollUp and scrollDown in ARRAY mode
    * Added some #ifdef to make code compatible in BUFFER mode.
    
2003-02-26	fabian

2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added highly experimental code to do custom drawing 
      for high speed. Still very buggy. To enable the 
      code, turn on the USE_CUSTOM_DRAWING flag in 
      PseudoTerminal.m, turn on the DEBUG_USE_ARRAY 
      and turn off the DEBUG_USE_BUFFER flags in VT100Screen.m
      
    * Fixed a problem causing huge CPU usage when displaying 
      the bell in tab. Now displaying only if there is a 
      change.
      

2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

2003-02-22	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug in resizing tabs and window when closing 
      a session.
      
    * Using smaller icon for popup menu in toolbar when 
      toolbar size mode is NSToolbarSizeModeSmall.
      
    * Further speed optimizations by caching rarely changing 
      character attribute dictionaries. We are also not 
      recreating our data stream in VT100Terminal every 
      time we pick off a token. That is too expensive. 
      We just mark our position in the stream and recreate 
      the stream only when we reach the end.

    * Manually firing screen update timer after a keyDown 
      to make user input more responsive.
      
    * Fixed memory leak by properly releasing BUFFER in 
      VT100Screen: -dealloc. Also no need to retain 
      BUFFER after alloc and init.
      
    * Fixed bug in accessing characters in buffer while 
      marking autowrap position.
      

2003-02-21	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in function key mapping: F1~F12
    * Fixed a bug in showCursor. Cleaned overall cursor
      Code.
    * Fixed bugs related to color/font settings in buffer
    * Fixed a bug affecting CJK input
    * Perfromace improvement. Now a buffer is used in
      displaying the text. Significantly improve the
      overall speed. Need more test.
      
2003-02-20	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added and implemented tabViewWillPerformDragOperation 
      tabViewDidPerformDragOperation delegate methods. This 
      gets rid of a visual glitch when doing drag-n-drop 
      within a window with only two tabs.
      

2003-02-19	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for a few xterm character attributes.
    
    * Tabs are dragged only after about 8 pixels to prevent 
      accidental dragging.
    

2003-02-16	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Changed implementation of cursorToX: Y: and 
      cursorToX: in VT100Screen. Was interfering 
      with resize command.
      

2003-02-14	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed encoding bug in PTYsession: -keyDown:
    
    * Workaround for a possible Cocoa bug in copy/paste.
    
    * Changed keyboard shortcuts to navigate sessions 
      from Cmd-1/2 to Cmd [ and Cmd ].
      
      
2003-02-13	fabian
    * Enhanced text input
    * Incorporated Japanese patch from OHKAWA
    
2003-02-12	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added preference to remap DELETE key to BACKSPACE.
    

2003-02-11	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Moved dead key code from PTYSession: -keyDown to 
      PTYTextView: -keyDown since that implements the 
      NSTextInput protocol.
      
    * Fixed a minor problem in VT100Screen: scrollUp 
      where an unwanted "\n" was inserted when 
      CURSOR_Y > SCROLL_BOTTOM.
      
    * Made flag to open session in new window in the toolbar 
      popup menu sticky.
      
    * Added GPL notice to all files.
      

2003-02-10	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for alternate keypad mode and 
      PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4 keys.
      
    * Fixed a bug in VT100Terminal: getCSIParam() 
      where the the paramters would be parsed into 
      incorrect array indices when blank (implied) 
      parameters were encountered. This is was messing 
      up some token processing where the position of 
      the parameters in the array was important like 
      [VT100Screen: -setTopBottom].
      
    * Fixed a cursor display bug in PseudoTerminal: -windowConfigOk.
      

2003-02-10	fabian
    * Cleaned up showCursor code
    * Incorparated Japanese nib files from OHKAWA

    * Added drag-and-drop support to the PTYTabView class. 
      Tabs can now be moved within and between windows.
      

2003-02-07	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Workaround for a problem in Bookmarks where the 
      scrollbar was not being activated when it should have 
      been on load. It was being activated only on window 
      resize. Looks like a Cocoa bug, but I put in a 
      workaround of telling the NSTableView that the 
      number of rows had changed after loading the addressbook.
      
    * This time really fixed the cursor updating problem. 
      Root cause was VT100: -deleteCharacters that sometimes 
      caused OLD_CURSOR_INDEX to end up with the incorrect 
      value.
	

2003-02-06	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
    
    * Now displaying tab number in label to make it easier

2003-02-05	fabian

      characters problem.
    * Localized new interface additions for zh_CN and zh_TW.
    * 0.6.3!
      
2003-02-04	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added menu item in tabview contextual menu to move 
      tab to new window.
      
    * Simplified PseudoTerminal code by removing direct 
      references to SCREEN, SCROLLVIEW, TEXTVIEW, TERMINAL, 
      TERM_VALUE. All these operate only on the PTYSession 
      object. Also simplified PseudoTerminal: -setupSession 
      code by moving a bunch of it into addSession which 
      is called by other stuff.
      
    * Fixed multi-line copy paste problem that was caused by
      line feed that is inserted when a command wraps over to 
      the next line. Now marking the position where the line 
      feed is inserted and removing it in the copy operation.
      

2003-02-03	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added submenus to tabview contextual menu. Tabview 
      contextual menu is now built and controlled by 
      the tabview delegate.
      

2003-02-02	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added basic Applescript support. One can now write 
      Applescripts to open one or more default or addressbook 
      sessions in a new tab or window. The syntax is:
      
      To open a new session in a new tab:
      launch session "<session_name>" in tab
      
      To open a new session in a new window:
      launch session "<session_name>" in terminal
      
      The <session_name> is either the name of a stored 
      addressbook session or "default session" for a 
      default session.
      
      Here is a sample Applescript:
      
      tell application "iTerm"
	activate
	launch session "default session" in tab
	launch session "Fink list" in terminal
      end tell
      
      These scripts can then be save as executable scripts.
      
    * Incorporated a modified patch by Aaron Gerber to escape 
      special characters out of a file name when doing a 
      drag-and-drop.

      the user has scrolled up. Typing something on the

      Chinese NIBs and localized strings file need to be

    * Fixed some horizontal tabbing issues in VT100Screeen.

      I wish NSTabView would offer to calculate its frame

2002-12-19	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented UI from button based to real-tab based

    * Updated strings files for Chinese
    
2002-12-16	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      addressbook popup menu gives similar functionality.
      Ideally, the icon for the popup button should be 
      the addressbook icon, but I couldn't get it to work.
      More research needs to be done on that...

      ended, and session name is enclosed in []
    * fixed a bug in screenSizeInFrame() in VT100Screen.m,
      which makes row/col smaller than it should be
      (this one need more test)

    * Re-implemented transparency code to affect only text 
     instead of the whole window. Had to subclass NSWindow 
     since I ran into a nasty window redrawing Cocoa bug.
     
    * Instantiating scroll view in code rather than in NIB 
      to make layout look better.
      
    * PseudoTerminal is now a NSWindowController rather 
      than a NSResponder. Later I will refactor the code 
      to make is a true window controller.
