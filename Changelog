      To execute in a new window, hold down the command 
      key while accessing the contextual menu.
    
    * Refactored the contextual menu code, so that the 
      text view does not have know about the address book 
      and session configuration.

2003-01-04	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Can't reproduce the emacs editing bug anymore.
    
    * Fixed an emulation problem handling the CSI_RI and

2003-01-01	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added Save/Print functionality.
      Chinese NIBs and localized strings file need to be 
      updated.
      
    * Fixed some horizontal tabbing issues in VT100Screeen.
      Now pre-populating tab array with tabs every TABWIDTH 
      on init since we won't always get CSI_HTS command 
      before a tab is issued. Also ensuring that we move 
      to the next tab if we are already on one.


2002-12-20	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug that cause the tabview item label 
      attributes to be released when any session was 
      closed. Dictionaries had been static class variables 
      instead of belonging to specific instances.
      
    * Optimized code for setting tab label attributes so 
      that the drawing code is not called unnecessarily.

      window when the config session window was closed 
      even though the window sizes were not changed.

      I wish NSTabView would offer to calculate its frame 
      based on content size just like NSScrollView.
    

2002-12-19	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented UI from button based to real-tab based 
      using NSTabView based on user feedback. Major code 
      changes and simplifications.
      
    * Fixed bug causing a crash when a session was closed 
      without the shell exiting with the "autoclose" 
      preference off.

2002-12-18	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Page up/down scrolling keys now need Shift key down

    * Updated strings files for Chinese
    
2002-12-16	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Removed addressbook toolbar item since the 
      addressbook popup menu gives similar functionality.
      Ideally, the icon for the popup button should be 
      the addressbook icon, but I couldn't get it to work.
      More research needs to be done on that...
      
    * Fixed bugs in MainMenu that did not save addressbook

      ended, and session name is enclosed in []
    * fixed a bug in screenSizeInFrame() in VT100Screen.m,
      which makes row/col smaller than it should be
      (this one need more test)
      
2002-12-07	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented transparency code to affect only text 
     instead of the whole window. Had to subclass NSWindow 
     since I ran into a nasty window redrawing Cocoa bug.
     
    * Instantiating scroll view in code rather than in NIB 
      to make layout look better.
      
    * PseudoTerminal is now a NSWindowController rather
