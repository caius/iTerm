    * fixed a bug that causes crash when a ended session 
      is manually closed
    * now a warning panel will pop out when you try to 
      close an active session
    * session button uses gray to suggest the session has 
      ended, and session name is enclosed in []
    * fixed a bug in screenSizeInFrame() in VT100Screen.m,
      which makes row/col smaller than it should be
      (this one need more test)

    * Re-implemented transparency code to affect only text 
     instead of the whole window. Had to subclass NSWindow 
     since I ran into a nasty window redrawing Cocoa bug.
     
    * Instantiating scroll view in code rather than in NIB 
      to make layout look better.
      
    * PseudoTerminal is now a NSWindowController rather 
      than a NSResponder. Later I will refactor the code 
      to make is a true window controller.
