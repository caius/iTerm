    * Added some missing semi-colons in Chinese strings files.


2003-03-08	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed an issue where '=', '/', and '*' could not be 
      typed from numeric keypad. This was because those 
      keys were mapped to the PF2, PF3, PF4 keys. Now we 
      have a numLock state that is on by default. When 
      state is enabled, numeric keypad has the default 
      operation. When it is disabled, the keys 
      'numlock', '=', '/', and '*' send PF1, PF2, PF3, 
      and PF4 sequences. The state can be toggled by using 
      Cmd-numLock. This behavior is basically the same as 
      that implemented in GLTerm.

      enhancements and fixes for some bugs and memory leaks.
      

2003-03-02	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a screen update bug. Sometimes screen HAS to be 
      updated even if minIndex == [BUFFER length], e.g. when 
      doing ^u on the last line.
      

2003-03-01	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a warning bell orientation bug.
    

2003-02-28	fabian

      in BUFFER mode
      
2003-02-27	fabian
    * Fixed cursor code in ARRAY mode
    * Fixed more double-width character stuff in ARRAY mode, 
      display should be fully working now

      decide the lineHeight.
    * Fixed bugs in scrollUp and scrollDown in ARRAY mode
    * Added some #ifdef to make code compatible in BUFFER mode.
    
2003-02-26	fabian

      less portion of screen
    * Fixed a showCursor bug
      
2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added highly experimental code to do custom drawing 
      for high speed. Still very buggy. To enable the 
      code, turn on the USE_CUSTOM_DRAWING flag in 
      PseudoTerminal.m, turn on the DEBUG_USE_ARRAY 
      and turn off the DEBUG_USE_BUFFER flags in VT100Screen.m
      
    * Fixed a problem causing huge CPU usage when displaying 
      the bell in tab. Now displaying only if there is a 
      change.
      

2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Now iTerm removes the warning icon when switching tabs.
    
2003-02-22	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug in resizing tabs and window when closing 
      a session.
      
    * Using smaller icon for popup menu in toolbar when 
      toolbar size mode is NSToolbarSizeModeSmall.
      
    * Further speed optimizations by caching rarely changing 
      character attribute dictionaries. We are also not 
      recreating our data stream in VT100Terminal every 
      time we pick off a token. That is too expensive. 
      We just mark our position in the stream and recreate 
      the stream only when we reach the end.
      

2003-02-21	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Manually firing screen update timer after a keyDown 
      to make user input more responsive.
      
    * Fixed memory leak by properly releasing BUFFER in 
      VT100Screen: -dealloc. Also no need to retain 
      BUFFER after alloc and init.
      
    * Fixed bug in accessing characters in buffer while 
      marking autowrap position.
      

2003-02-21	fabian

    * Fixed a bug in showCursor. Cleaned overall cursor
      Code.
    * Fixed bugs related to color/font settings in buffer

      overall speed. Need more test.
      
2003-02-20	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added and implemented tabViewWillPerformDragOperation 
      tabViewDidPerformDragOperation delegate methods. This 
      gets rid of a visual glitch when doing drag-n-drop 
      within a window with only two tabs.
      

2003-02-19	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for a few xterm character attributes.
    
    * Tabs are dragged only after about 8 pixels to prevent 
      accidental dragging.
    

2003-02-16	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Changed implementation of cursorToX: Y: and 
      cursorToX: in VT100Screen. Was interfering 
      with resize command.
      

2003-02-14	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed encoding bug in PTYsession: -keyDown:

    * Incorporated Japanese patch from OHKAWA
    
2003-02-12	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added preference to remap DELETE key to BACKSPACE.
    

2003-02-11	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Moved dead key code from PTYSession: -keyDown to 
      PTYTextView: -keyDown since that implements the 
      NSTextInput protocol.
      
    * Fixed a minor problem in VT100Screen: scrollUp 
      where an unwanted "\n" was inserted when 
      CURSOR_Y > SCROLL_BOTTOM.
      
    * Made flag to open session in new window in the toolbar 
      popup menu sticky.
      
    * Added GPL notice to all files.
      

2003-02-10	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for alternate keypad mode and 
      PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4 keys.
      
    * Fixed a bug in VT100Terminal: getCSIParam() 
      where the the paramters would be parsed into 
      incorrect array indices when blank (implied) 
      parameters were encountered. This is was messing 
      up some token processing where the position of 
      the parameters in the array was important like 
      [VT100Screen: -setTopBottom].
      
    * Fixed a cursor display bug in PseudoTerminal: -windowConfigOk.
      

2003-02-10	fabian
    * Cleaned up showCursor code
    * Incorparated Japanese nib files from OHKAWA
    * Fixed a bug in scrollUp
    
2003-02-09	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added drag-and-drop support to the PTYTabView class. 
      Tabs can now be moved within and between windows.
      

2003-02-07	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Workaround for a problem in Address Book where the 
      scrollbar was not being activated when it should have 
      been on load. It was being activated only on window 
      resize. Looks like a Cocoa bug, but I put in a 
      workaround of telling the NSTableView that the 
      number of rows had changed after loading the addressbook.
      
    * This time really fixed the cursor updating problem. 
      Root cause was VT100: -deleteCharacters that sometimes 
      caused OLD_CURSOR_INDEX to end up with the incorrect 
      value.
	

2003-02-06	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
    
    * Now displaying tab number in label to make it easier 
      to switch between tabs using function keys.
      
    * Changed version number in Info.plist to 0.6.3.
      

2003-02-05	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in showCursor that causes the loss of
      attributes. That partially solves the double-width
      characters problem.
    * Localized new interface additions for zh_CN and zh_TW.
    * 0.6.3!
      
2003-02-04	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added menu item in tabview contextual menu to move 
      tab to new window.
      
    * Simplified PseudoTerminal code by removing direct 
      references to SCREEN, SCROLLVIEW, TEXTVIEW, TERMINAL, 
      TERM_VALUE. All these operate only on the PTYSession 
      object. Also simplified PseudoTerminal: -initSession 
      code by moving a bunch of it into addSession which 
      is called by other stuff.
      
    * Fixed multi-line copy paste problem that was caused by
      line feed that is inserted when a command wraps over to 
      the next line. Now marking the position where the line 
      feed is inserted and removing it in the copy operation.
      

2003-02-03	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added submenus to tabview contextual menu. Tabview 
      contextual menu is now built and controlled by 
      the tabview delegate.
      

2003-02-02	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added basic Applescript support. One can now write 
      Applescripts to open one or more default or addressbook 
      sessions in a new tab or window. The syntax is:
      
      To open a new session in a new tab:
      launch session "<session_name>" in tab
      
      To open a new session in a new window:
      launch session "<session_name>" in terminal
      
      The <session_name> is either the name of a stored 
      addressbook session or "default session" for a 
      default session.
      
      Here is a sample Applescript:
      
      tell application "iTerm"
	activate
	launch session "default session" in tab
	launch session "Fink list" in terminal
      end tell
      
      These scripts can then be save as executable scripts.
      
    * Incorporated a modified patch by Aaron Gerber to escape 
      special characters out of a file name when doing a 
      drag-and-drop.
      

2003-01-31	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      Configuration panel, and Address Book entries. 
      Minimum size is 1x1.
      
    * We don't autoscroll to the bottom on shell output if 
      the user has scrolled up. Typing something on the 
      command line will trigger an autoscroll again.
      

2003-01-29	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Incorporated patch by Aaron Gerber to add a "Cancel" 
      button in the preferences panel.

2003-01-13	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added an option to copy selected text to emulate 
      X copy/paste. This requires a multi-button mouse 
      with one of the buttons programmed to be "Cmd-V" or 
      "paste".
      

2003-01-10	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

2002-12-21	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added Save/Print functionality.
      Chinese NIBs and localized strings file need to be 
      updated.
      
    * Fixed some horizontal tabbing issues in VT100Screeen.
      Now pre-populating tab array with tabs every TABWIDTH 
      on init since we won't always get CSI_HTS command 
      before a tab is issued. Also ensuring that we move 
      to the next tab if we are already on one.


2002-12-20	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug that cause the tabview item label

      closed. Dictionaries had been static class variables 
      instead of belonging to specific instances.
      
    * Optimized code for setting tab label attributes so 
      that the drawing code is not called unnecessarily.

      window when the config session window was closed 
      even though the window sizes were not changed.
      
    * Fixed a window sizing problem that was evident in vi.
      I wish NSTabView would offer to calculate its frame 
      based on content size just like NSScrollView.
    

2002-12-19	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented UI from button based to real-tab based 
      using NSTabView based on user feedback. Major code 
      changes and simplifications.
      
    * Fixed bug causing a crash when a session was closed 
      without the shell exiting with the "autoclose" 
      preference off.
      
    * Disabled the limit on the window size. Not sure why
      that was there.

2002-12-18	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Page up/down scrolling keys now need Shift key down 
      a la xterm since some programs like vi need to

    * Removed addressbook toolbar item since the 
      addressbook popup menu gives similar functionality.
      Ideally, the icon for the popup button should be 
      the addressbook icon, but I couldn't get it to work.
      More research needs to be done on that...
      
    * Fixed bugs in MainMenu that did not save addressbook

    * Rewritten all the encoding related code. Now all 
      the encodings that are available on the system will

      ended, and session name is enclosed in []
    * fixed a bug in screenSizeInFrame() in VT100Screen.m,
      which makes row/col smaller than it should be
      (this one need more test)
      
2002-12-07	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented transparency code to affect only text 
     instead of the whole window. Had to subclass NSWindow 
     since I ran into a nasty window redrawing Cocoa bug.
     
    * Instantiating scroll view in code rather than in NIB 
      to make layout look better.
      
    * PseudoTerminal is now a NSWindowController rather
