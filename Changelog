2002-12-16	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Removed addressbook toolbar item since the 
      addressbook popup menu gives similar functionality.
      Ideally, the icon for the popup button should be 
      the addressbook icon, but I couldn't get it to work.
      More research needs to be done on that...
      
    * Fixed bugs in MainMenu that did not save addressbook 
      when entries were deleted.

    * Rewritten all the encoding related code. Now all 
      the encodings that are available on the system will 
      be usable.

       manually updated)

    * session button uses gray to suggest the session has 
      ended, and session name is enclosed in []
    * fixed a bug in screenSizeInFrame() in VT100Screen.m,
      which makes row/col smaller than it should be
      (this one need more test)
      
2002-12-07	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented transparency code to affect only text 
     instead of the whole window. Had to subclass NSWindow 
     since I ran into a nasty window redrawing Cocoa bug.
     
    * Instantiating scroll view in code rather than in NIB 
      to make layout look better.
      
    * PseudoTerminal is now a NSWindowController rather 
      than a NSResponder. Later I will refactor the code 
      to make is a true window controller.
