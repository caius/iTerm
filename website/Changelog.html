This build has some significant changes in the character rendering. It will give the fonts a more
standard anti-aliasing looking. If you have previously played with the stroke width setting, please
set it to 0 to see the new effect:<BR><BR>

defaults write iTerm StrokeWidth -float 0<BR><BR>

Known bug: when the font size is set to a value below certain threshold, antialiasing is turned off 
no matter what. For Monaco, this threshold is 11.<BR><BR>
