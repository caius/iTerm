<LI>Added support for handling URLs. The following macros can be used in handler's command:<BR>
		$$URL$$, $$HOST$$, $$USER$$, $$PASSWORD$$, $$PORT$$, $$PATH$$<BR>
	  For example, a bookmark's command is: telnet -l $$USER$$ $$HOST$$ $$PORT$$, and the
	  URL is: telnet://joe@fancyland.com:23<BR>
	  This will give you this command: telnet -l joe fancyland.com 23</LI>
<LI>Allowing users to specify parameters in bookmarks' command. For example, if the command is
