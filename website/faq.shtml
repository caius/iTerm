<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Does iTerm require mono-space fonts?</STRONG><BR>
	Versions before 0.8 require monospace fonts. New version no longer requires monospace 
	fonts. All fonts will be displayed in correct alignment.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Where does iTerm store its settings?</STRONG><BR>
	The settings is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/iTerm.plist. The bookmarks data file before
    version 0.8.0 is ~/Library/Application Support/iTerm/Addressbook. Since version 0.8.0, 
    everything is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/iTerm.plist. In case something goes wrong, 
    you can delete these files and iTerm will generate new copies that should always work.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>My iTerm is too slow. What can I do to improve its performance?</STRONG><BR>
	First of all, upgrade to the latest version. We are constantly updating the program to
	improve its performance. The latest version should run at least as fast as Apple's Terminal.app.
	Secondly, there are a couple of things you can tweak. iTerm does the fast drawing by 
	caching the images of glyphs in the memory. Anything that helps to save memory helps 
	the performance. Avoid using a big scrollback buffer. This would use a lot of memory 
	especially if you have lots of tab open. Keeping windows geometry and font size small 
	helps too. Disable anti-aliasing does a minimal effect on speed.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>My settings of bookmarks do not seem to always work. Why?</STRONG><BR>
	For various reasons, some settings like numbers of row/col, fonts, etc. are enforced
	to be the same among all the tabs within a window. Therefore, only the settings of first
	tab in the window will be honored. You can however specifiy different terminal types,
	different colors, etc.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>The fonts are looking weird. What should I do?</STRONG><BR>
	iTerm lets you to specify two fonts. If you only use English or western european languages,
	you probably only need to set the font for ASCII characters. For other languages, you
	need to specify a font that works with your language as the Non-ASCII font. You need to
	make sure the size (height) of two fonts do not differ greatly, so iTerm won't display
	a mess of mixed glyphs.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Characters on screen are not aligned correctly.</STRONG><BR>
	Check the option for "use double width for Non-ASCII characters.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>I can't input Chinese/Japanese/Umlauts/Accents, why?</STRONG><BR>
	First of all, make sure your encoding settings is correct. For example, there
	are several encoding standards for Chinese, you need to know which one is used on
	your system. If you are running a local session, unicode is the standard of Mac OS X.
	Secondly, if you are running a telnet session, be sure you turned on the 8-bit data path.
	Try using "telnet -8 yourhost" in your command.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Can I completely hide the toolbar?</STRONG><BR>
	Yes, you can. The oblong button on the top right corner of the window does the trick.<BR><BR></LI>
