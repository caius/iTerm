<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Why my arrow/HOME/END keys are not working?</STRONG><BR>

    When the terminal type of your sessions is set to one of those "xterm" types, 
    iTerm handles the arrow keys, the home key, and the end key in a special way. 
    The escape sequences generated by these keys depend on if your session is in 
    the normal mode or the cursor application mode. For the normal mode, iTerm 
    generates ESC [ sequences. For the cursor application mode, iTerm generates 
    ESC O sequences.<BR><BR>

    These two modes are respected by many console programs. Most shells are good 
    with the normal mode. Full screen applications such as vi and emacs usually 
    use cursor application mode. Termcap and terminfo are written for full screen
    applications, so they will report the cursor application mode sequences.<BR><BR>

    In any case, if your keys are not working, first check if iTerm is set to 
    correct terminal type. The terminal type set in the terminal profile should 
    match the TERM variable in your session environment. Scripts like 
    bashrc may change the terminal type and create some problem. Secondly, check 
    if there's any customized key bindings for these keys. These settings will 
    override the default behavior. And lastly, check if you have set up your 
    console application correctly. In some system, vi by default works in the 
    original vi mode, which does not support arrow keys.<BR><BR>

    If everything else fails, you can fire up another terminal program that works
    for you, check the escape sequences generated by arrow keys in those program, 
    and go back to iTerm, type these key sequences in your keyboard profile.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI><STRONG>I can't input Chinese/Japanese/Umlauts/Accents, why?</STRONG><BR>
	First of all, make sure your encoding settings is correct. For example, there
	are several encoding standards for Chinese, you need to know which one is used on
	your system. If you are running a local session, unicode is the standard of Mac OS X.<BR><BR>
	To enable inputing unicode characters in your shell, put this in your ~/.inputrc<BR><BR>
    
        set meta-flag on<BR>
        set input-meta on<BR>
        set output-meta on<BR>
        set convert-meta off<BR><BR>
        
    If you are running a telnet session, be sure you turned on the 8-bit data path.
	Try using "telnet -8 yourhost" in your command.<BR><BR></LI>
 
<LI><STRONG>Where does iTerm store its settings?</STRONG><BR>
	Since version 0.8.0, all the setting is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/iTerm.plist. 
	In case something goes wrong, you can delete this file and iTerm will generate a new
	settings file that should always work.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>My iTerm is too slow. What can I do to improve its performance?</STRONG><BR>
	First of all, upgrade to the latest version. We are constantly updating the program to
	improve its performance. The latest version should run at least as fast as Apple's 
	Terminal.app. Secondly, there are a couple of things you can tweak. iTerm does the fast
	drawing by caching the images of glyphs in the memory. Anything that helps to save memory 
	helps the performance. Avoid using a big scrollback buffer. This would use a lot of memory 
	especially if you have lots of tab open. Keeping windows geometry and font size small 
	helps too. Disable anti-aliasing does a minimal effect on speed.<BR><BR>
	Since version 0.9.0, there is a new option to allow users to adjust the display refresh
	rate. Fast refreshing rate means more CPU usage, and it might decrease performance when
	there is a lot of scrolling.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>My settings of bookmarks do not seem to always work. Why?</STRONG><BR>
	For various reasons, most size settings such as numbers of row/col, fonts, etc. need
	to be the same among all the tabs within a window. Therefore, only the settings of first
	tab in the window will be honored. You can however specifiy different terminal types,
	different colors, etc.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Does iTerm require mono-space fonts?</STRONG><BR>
	Versions before 0.8 require monospace fonts. New version no longer requires monospace 
	fonts. All fonts will be displayed in correct alignment.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>The fonts are looking weird. What should I do?</STRONG><BR>
	iTerm lets you to specify two fonts. If you only use English or western european languages,
	you probably only need to set the font for ASCII characters. For other languages, you
	need to specify a font that works with your language as the Non-ASCII font. You need to
	make sure the size (height) of two fonts do not differ greatly, so iTerm won't display
	a mess of mixed glyphs.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>The anti-aliasing looks funny. Is there a way to adjust it?</STRONG><BR>
	Yes, there  is. There is a hidden setting of StokeWidth and BoldStrokeWidth that you can
	play with. See the <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/resource.shtml">Resource</a> page
	for details. Set them to 0 gives you a standard anti-alias rendering. Any negative number
	gives you a bolder look.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Characters on screen are not aligned correctly.</STRONG><BR>
	Check the option for "use double width for Non-ASCII characters".<BR><BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Can I completely hide the toolbar?</STRONG><BR>
	Yes, you can. The oblong button on the top right corner of the window does the trick.<BR><BR></LI>
