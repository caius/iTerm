<STRONG>New localization packages</STRONG><IMG src="new.gif">  2/28/07<BR>
I am no language genius, but I did spend some time learning some Spanish. As I'm trying to improve my Spanish, I decide to make
a Spanish localization package for the latest version of iTerm. Be warned. Some translations may be awkward or totally wrong. 
If there are any native Spanish speakers out there, any corrections or advice will be much appreciated (wanna be my penpal? :-)). 
Muchas gracias!! <BR><BR>
To download, check our <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/localization.shtml">Localization</a> page. Also updated is the simplified
Chinese package for the latest iTerm.

</UL>

<STRONG>Go Full Screen!</STRONG> 1/24/07<BR>
Happy 2007!! We are continuing working on improving our iTerm. The first exciting new feature
we are introducing in the new year is the support for the full screen mode. You can turn any
terminal window into full screen. Although the tab bar will be hidden, you can still use
your keyboard to navigate between tabs under the full screen mode.  You can go to the 
<A HREF="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/download.shtml">download page</a> and test the latest CVS 
build.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>0.9.4 for Panther</STRONG> 12/21/06<BR>
Merry Christmas to everybody! The build for Panther is finally available. This build includes a 
few post-0.9.4 fixes. For Tiger users, please download the latest CVS build (0.9.4.1221). It 
will be our last build before Christmas.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Release 0.9.4</STRONG> 12/4/06<BR>
This version further improves on stability. Further more, we changed the font rendering to make
it more in line with other Cocoa applications. Lastly, we have an updated Help that reflects the
latest changes in the GUI. We encourage all users who use previous versions to upgrade. New changes 
include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>New font rendering code.</LI>
<LI>Updated Help documentation.</LI>
<LI>Improved support for the wide glyphs, especially for the eastern asian languages.</LI>
<LI>Added a Google command in the context menu to launch a search session with selected text.</LI>
<LI>Improved speed.</LI>
<LI>Enhanced stability.</LI>
<LI>Other bug fixes and GUI enhancements as usual.</LI>
</UL>

Go to the <A HREF="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/download.shtml">Download page</A> 
and check it out. We have Tiger only version now. A Panther version will be released after a few
issues are addressed.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Font rendering</STRONG> 11/29/06<BR>
For people who have complained the less than ideal font rendering behavior of iTerm, we hear you, loud and
clear. Our latest cvs build hopefully alleviates some of your pain. You can go to the 
<A HREF="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/download.shtml">download page</a> and check
it out. If you have played with the stroke width setting before, you might need to set it to
0 before you can see our new rendering effects:
<ul>defaults write iTerm StrokeWidth -float 0</ul>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Release 0.9.3</STRONG> 11/11/06<BR>
This is mainly a bug fix version. The stability has been greatly enhancced. Random crashes that
plagued previous 0.9.x version should be largely eliminated. Other changes include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Terminfo support.</LI>
<LI>New Execute field in toolbar for type in commands and URLs.</LI>
<LI>Open all bookmarks with a folder.</LI>
<LI>Paste strings with escape characters.</LI>
<LI>Use option key to temporarily disable xterm mouse reporting.</LI>
<LI>Added a "high priority" option to key mapping.</LI>
<LI>Enhanced stability.</LI>
<LI>Other bug fixes and GUI enhancements as usual.</LI>
</UL>

Go to the <A HREF="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/download.shtml">Download page</A> 
and check it out.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Terminfo support is here!</STRONG> 11/1/06<BR>
Our latest CVS build features terminfo support. The keyboard mapping of a session will
now use the terminfo library. Your customized keymappings will override the terminfo library though.
So you should probably remove some settings in your keyboard profile for you to see terminfo
at work.<BR><BR>

This CVS build also fixes a few embarrassing bugs in the 0.9.2 release. Go to the 
<A HREF="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/download.shtml">Download page</A> 
and check it out.<BR><BR>
 
<STRONG>Release 0.9.2</STRONG> 10/29/06<BR>
This new release features a new preference system. It is based on the same "Profiles-oriented" idea of
previous version, with enhancement targeted toward the user experiences. The new changes include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>A Change of preferences settings:<br>
    <UL>
	<LI> Move bookmark tab to a separate window. Added an option to display bookmark window
         on startup.</LI>
    <LI> Move profiles window outside of Preference Panel</LI>
         <UL>
		 <LI> The Profiles window shows profiles on the left and their contents on the right.</LI>
         <LI> Now allows to rename a profile.</LI>
         <LI> Now allows to edit existing keymapping.</LI>
         </UL>
    <LI> Changed Preference Panel into 5 tabs. Any changes in these settings are immediate effecitve. 
	     Ok/Cancel buttons are gone.</LI>
    <LI> Renamed Configure window to Info to avoid confusion. </LI>
         <UL>
		 <LI> Made the window long to make it look like an Info window.</LI>
         <LI> Cmd-I to open and close window.</LI>
         <LI> Added a button to allow updating.</LI>
         </UL>
    <LI> Re-ordered main menu.</LI>
         <UL>
		 <LI> added a bookmark menu. Opening a window or a tab is controlled by option key.</LI>
         <LI> Moved tab operations into Windows menu.</LI>
         <LI> Added "Return to Default Size" menu item.</LI>
		 <LI> Script menu no longer shows when there are no scripts found.</LI>
         </UL>
	<LI> Added option to quit iTerm when all windows are closed</LI>
	<LI> Enhanced About dialog. It's now shown on startup whenever you installed a new version.</LI>
	</UL>
<LI>Now iTerm is able to check updates automatically using Sparkle framework.</LI>
<LI>Added support for handling URLs. The following macros can be used in handler's command:<BR>
		$$URL$$, $$HOST$$, $$USER$$, $$PASSWORD$$, $$PORT$$, $$PATH$$<BR>
	  For example, a bookmark's command is: telnet -l $$USER$$ $$HOST$$ $$PORT$$, and the
	  URL is: telnet://joe@fancyland.com:23<BR>
	  This will give you this command: telnet -l joe fancyland.com 23</LI>
<LI>Allowing users to specify parameters in bookmarks' command. For example, if the command is
	  ssh $$User Name$$@myserver.com, when you start this session, iTerm will ask you to enter
	  the "User Name", then plug your input into the command and run the session.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the ESC sequence to show/hide cursor.</LI>
<LI>Added a visual to indicate whether "send to all session" is turned on or not.</LI>
<LI>Primitive support for terminfo/termcap. The termcap definition for a key is used when there is no customized keymapping.</LI>
<LI>Enhanced stability.</LI>
<LI>Many many bug fixes and GUI enhancements.</LI>
</UL>

<STRONG>iTerm It All!</STRONG> 10/26/06
A true geek does everything in command lines, web, ftp, everything. Or maybe
your more modest goal is just to get the telnet link to work. Now iTerm
features the support to associate URLs with your bookmarks. You can set up a
bookmark session with a command like this:<br><br>
 telnet -l $$USER$$ $$HOST$$ $$PORT$$<br><br> and then tell OS X that iTerm will 
be the default handler for the telnet protocol. Next time you click a link in 
a Safari window such as telnet://joe@myserver.net:80, voila, there is your
telnet session with the user name, host address and port number passed to it.<br><br>

<STRONG>Sparkling New!</STRONG> 10/16/06<BR>
In the latest cvs build, we have added Sparkle framework into our iTerm. That means,
now the application will check the update, download the new version and install it
all by itself. Well, with your permission, of course. <br><br>

<STRONG>Moving on</STRONG> 10/14/06<BR>
We received many good feeedbacks on our 0.9.0 release. In the meanwhile, we are moving
on to the next release to address many issues that users have raised. The main focus
on 0.9.1 version will be the user interface. We will release CVS builds periodically.
You are welcome to test-drive the new UI and send us your feedback. Be warned these
are alpha quality and you shouldn't rely your critical job on them.<BR><br>

<STRONG>Release 0.9.0!!!</STRONG> 9/22/06<BR>
Thanks to all the people who sent in their suggestion, feedback and bug reports.
iTerm 0.9.0 is finally here. We have made the transistion to the new PSMTabBarControl.
It gives iTerm a Safari-looking tab system. Further more, it supports drag and drop. 
This is a major upgrade from 0.8.2. The changes include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>A brand new Safari-like tab look.</LI>
<LI>Growl support.</LI>
<LI>Support for Unsanity's Smart Crash Reporter.</LI>
<LI>Added support for many xterm's window size/position escape sequences.</LI>
<LI>Enhanced stability.</LI>
<LI>Fixes for cmd-click URL selection.</LI>
<LI>Many many bug fixes and GUI enhancements.</LI>
</UL>

<STRONG>Pre-Release</STRONG> 9/22/06<BR>
We are almost ready to put out a new release. The latest CVS build is therefore
called Pre-Release. Since we do not think a little bump of number after the 2nd 
decimal point justifies the change in the release, we are moving to the 0.9.x era.
The latest change include a fix of CMD-click to open a URL. Happy clicking!<BR><br>

<STRONG>Localizations</STRONG> 9/22/2006<BR>
Up to today, we have Chinese, French, German, Japanese and Korean localizations. 
We do not speak most of these languages, at least not well enough to create a 
complete translation. Our users offered us their help. However, iTerm is still
under active developping, and there are lots of changes. It is difficult to keep 
the translations up to date. Therefore, we would like to adopt a different model 
for localization. Starting from the coming new release, we will only provide
a slim version of iTerm that only includes the resource for English. We will provide
downloads for other languages if we receive localization packages from our users.
That way, we can focus on creating a bug-free user interface. It will also take some
burden off our translators. Whoever would like to help can download an existing 
localization package, update it and send it back to us.<br><br>

Many thanks to those who have made their contributions!<br><br>

<STRONG>Display Responsiveness</STRONG> 9/18/2006<BR>
Many people have complaints about the refreshing rate and the overall
responsiveness of iTerm. We have been trying to strike a balance between CPU
usage and program responsiveness. As this balance very much depends on
the user hardware as well as software configurations, it should be configurable.
So I think many of you would be glad to know that we have added a UI to allow
the adujstion of this setting. It's in the preference menu. Use a small
number for a faster refreshing rate and better responsiveness, for example,
when you are editing a file using vi. On the other hand, if you have a lot
things scrolling by quickly that you don't really care, set it to a larger
number. This allows CPU to rest a little bit more. The original setting corresponds
to the middle of the sliding bar. <BR><BR>

and check out the recent CVS build.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>iTerm Growling</STRONG> 9/15/2006<BR>
We are happily announcing that iTerm now integrates the support for Growl. You need to have 
<a href="http://www.growl.info">Growl</a> installed. Besides a few tab status related
messages (you can choose which one you need from Growl's preference setting), iTerm now also
supports an escape sequence that sends message via Growl: ESC ]9;string^G. <BR><BR>
For example, if you would like to get an alert after a long make, do this under bash will help:<BR><BR>
make;  echo $'\e]9;make done\007'<BR><BR>
Go to the <A HREF="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/download.shtml">Download page</A> 
and check out the recent CVS build.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>New Look</STRONG> 9/12/2006<BR>
We are experimenting with a new tab control (PSMTabBarControl) that can mimic Safari-like tabs. Download the
<A HREF="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/iTerm-latest-cvs.zip">binary build</A> 
from the latest CVS and check it out.<BR><BR>
